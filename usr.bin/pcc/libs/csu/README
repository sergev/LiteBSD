OS-dependent and target-dependent:

To be provided by the target's libc:
(the corresponding code included in this archive is mere incomplete
examples, can be possibly useful to replace the platform-provided ones,
but only on exceptionally broken platforms)

crt0.o		startup code for programs (maybe compiled -static)
crt1.o		a different flavour of startup code (iff the platform needs
		this in certain platform-specific situations)
gcrt[01].o	the corresponding profiling startup code for programs
crti.o		beginning of _init() and _fini() functions (inside .init section)
crtn.o		end of _init() and _fini() functions (inside .fini section)

To be provided by the compiler, needed if constructors/destructors are
desired, p++ is generated or library calls expects their existence.

crtbegin.o	support for calling global ctors/dtors
crtend.o	end of the ctor/dtor lists
if a difference from crtbegin.o/crtend.o is enforced by the platform:
crtbeginT.o	+ for static binary
crtendT.o	+ for static binary
crtbeginS.o	+ for shared library
crtendS.o	+ for shared library
